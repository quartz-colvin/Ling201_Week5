# Practice: complex sentences (if time!)

Identify the dependent clause and complementizer (if any) in each of these sentences, and determine whether the CP is acting as an NP, AdvP, or AdjP, and whether it is being inserted into an NP or a VP.

--

1. John said that he likes pizza.

2. I want to go to California.

3. I saw a deer that was grazing in the park.
