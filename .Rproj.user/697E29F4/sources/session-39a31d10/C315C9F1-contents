# Order of affixation 

- consider the words *unbelievable* and *renewable*. 

  - How many morphemes do they each have? 
  
  - What's the root? Are there prefixes or suffixes? 

--

- Now imagine you start with the root and then add affixes until you get the full word. Do you start with the prefix or suffix? Which do you add first?

  - Is it *un* + *believable* **or** *unbelieve* + *able*? Why? 
  
  - Is it *renew* + *able* **or** *re* + *newable*? Why?

---

# Order of affixation 

- Even though *unbelievable* and *renewable* both have three morphemes (prefix-root-suffix), there seems to be something different about the order in which the morphemes are added to the root!

--

In *un*-**believ**-*able* you add the suffix first and the prefix second
  
--

  1. Does adding an affix make a real word? **believ**-*able* is a real word, but \**un*-**believe** is not
    
    - What does the word mean? *unbelievable* means *not believable*, not *able to be unbelieved* 

--

In *re*-**new**-*able*, you add the suffix first and the prefix second

--

   1. Does adding an affix make a real word? *re*-**new** is a real word, but \***new**-*able* is not
  
  - What does the word mean? *renewable* means *able to be renewed*, not *newable again*

---

# Order of affixation 

This suggest that the **order of affixation**- the order in which you add affixes to a root- plays a role in the morphology of a word!

--

- different words have different orders of affixation 

- order of affixation is part of our mental grammar (what we know about a word as speakers)

--

- we can test a word's order of affixation by:

  - adding an affix and seeing if it makes a real word

--

  - trying to understand what the word means. if your definition involves some smaller combination of the root and an affix, it suggests that the affix is added first 

--

***neither of these tests works 100% of the time, so you should try a combination of them!***

# Morphological trees

## Hierarchical structure

- order of affixation is somehow connected to the *meaning* of a word

- the fact that we can't add affixes in any order suggests that words have a **hierarchical structure**

--

- we can visualize this structure with a **tree diagram**!

---

# Hierarchical structure

We can visualize this structue with a tree diagram...

- we **start at the bottom** with the root and **build upward**, adding affixes until we get to the full word at the top

--

- an alternative notation is **labeled bracketing**, which is more compact but perhaps less intuitive

--

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> un [<sub>V</sub> [<sub>V</sub> believe ] able ]]

  - [<sub>Adj</sub> [<sub>V</sub> re [<sub>Adj</sub> new ]] able ]

# Trees!

# Trees 

**How to draw a morphological tree:**

1. identify the word's morphemes and write them out separately in one row *(leave plenty of space above them!)*

--

2. identify the root(s) and label their part of speech

--

3. look at the morphemes immediately before and after the root. Which one is added first? Draw lines upward connecting them, and label the new word's part of speech

--

4. this new word becomes the base you'll keep building off of. Repeat step 3 using this new base instead of the root, and continue until you have no unconnected morphemes left

***Reminders:***

- start at the root and move outward/upward

- remember to mark the part of speech at every step/node

- of adding an affix makes something that isn't a word, try adding a different affix instead

- if adding an affix makes something that seems unrelated to the overall word's meaning, try adding a different affix instead

# Undoable

- Does it mean something different if it's *undo* + *able* vs. *un* + *doable*? How would you define each word?

# Morphological ambiguity 

---

# Morphological ambiguity 

- this word (***undoable***) is an example of a word with an ambiguous structure 

--

- **structural ambiguity:** depending on the structure you assign it, it has a different meaning 

--

- this suggests that tree drawing isn't just a game: the **meaning** of words is directly affected by their morphological structure!

--

- without knowing the structure, we wouldn't know how to put together the meanings of a word's different morphemes to create the full word
